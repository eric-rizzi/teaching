# Middle School Computer Science

This course provides students an first look into the world of computation
and exposes students to big ideas in Computer Science. It is intended to demystify
the computer and give students the confidence to look "inside" the various
abstractions that give computers their power.

# High School Introduction to Computer Science

Somewhat presciently, CS was added as a requirement to Lab in the late 70's.
Since then, this full year course has prepared freshman for any Computer Science
needs they might have throughout their High School career. Topics covered
include number systems, digitization, Python programming, recursion, and
general problem solving.

# Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence

The purpose of this course is to simultaneously teach students the equivalent of
an "advanced python" course and introduce them to various state of the art
techniques in ML/AI.

# Advanced Independent Study

The purpose of this course is to provide a track for advanced students in
**either** the HS Intro to CS course **OR** the ML/AI course that will challenge
them without interferring/colliding with anything else they might be learning.
The course goes from the creation of simple Python based games all the way up to
the deployment of a modern JavaScript App with calls to an AWS hosted back-end.
It relies heavily on the use of ChatBots to allow the student to make
independent progress.
