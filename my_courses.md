# Middle School Computer Science

This course provides students an introductory look into the world of computers
and exposes them to big ideas in computer science. It is intended to demystify
the computer and give students the confidence to look "inside" the various
abstractions that give computers their power.

# High School Introduction to Computer Science

Somewhat presciently, CS was added as a requirement to lab in the late 70's.
Since then, this full year course has prepared freshman for any computer science
needs they might have throughout their High School career. Topics covered
include number systems, digitization, python programming, and various important
CS topics.
