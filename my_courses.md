# Middle School Computer Science

This course provides students an introductory look into the world of computers
and exposes them to big ideas in computer science. It is intended to demystify
the computer and give students the confidence to look "inside" the various
abstractions that give computers their power.

## Course Highlights

The middle school course emphasizes creativity, drawing, movement (when
possible), and sharing of students work in the class. Units include:

#### Scratch Game Progression

Students begin the class with a series of five games of increasing complexity.
Each game is easily understandable, fun to play, can be completed by all levels
of students in a class period, and is easily extendable. The progression allows
for a rhythm to quickly build where students learn a new concept and then
quickly apply it.

#### Abstraction in All Forms

The course has a four class unit on abstraction where students are asked to
analyze abstraction from a variety of different angles. This includes drawing
their own abstract art for a pictionary-type game, understanding how a toilet
works, and solving a series of logic puzzles. In the end, students come away
with an appreciation for why abstraction is important for thinking and
communicating with others as well as how it is used within computer science.

#### Harry Potter Themed Terminal Scavenger Hunt

This unit teaches students the bare essentials of terminal. In the process, they
are required to remember information they previously learned in the class and
have a great time running around the school trying to find the next clue for
the hunt.

The reason this lesson is powerful is not because they learn a bunch of commands
for the terminal. Instead, it is because it addresses the fact that most
students have an innate belief that the terminal is something "evil" that only
hackers or the geniuses would use. By having them quickly learn the basics of
something that seemed mysterious to them before, they gain confidence when
approaching new technolgy.

# Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence

The purpose of the course is to simultaneously teach students the equivalent of
an "advanced python" course and introduce them to various state of the art
techniques in AI/ML.
