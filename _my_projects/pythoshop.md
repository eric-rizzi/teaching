# PythoShop

PythoShop is a really cool application build by the Dan from the UCLS CS
department. It's based on a series of worksheets created by Marty from the
CS department, which, in turn, is based on a idea out of Georgia Tech.

In essence, the project is a version of PhotoShop that asks students to create
a series of filters and tools to interact with and modify images. This includes
doing things like blending images, green-screening, creating borders, and
converting pictures to grayscale. In the process, students learn how to iterate
through data and get the satisfaction of seeing their work represented visually.

The project is great because it scales to all manner of skill levels, is
engaging, and provides instant feedback to students about whether they have
the correct code.
