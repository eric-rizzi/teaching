    <h1>3D Printing CSV Data</h1>

    <p>
    I worked with the science department (physics) to allow them to 3D print data
    that the students gathered during various experiments. It initially came about
    as a way to show students what measurements of magnetism on a electrified plate
    looks like, but it really can be anything. For example, the picture below shows
    the result of the conversion which can then be used to 3D print the data.
    </p>

    <!-- Image inclusion -->
    <img src="/teaching/assets/stl_conversion.png" alt="Picture of converted csv data">

    <!-- File upload interface -->
    <div id="upload_form">
        <p>Click here to upload a `.csv` file and get the converted `.stl`</p>
        <div>
            <input id="fileUpload" type="file" />
            <button onclick="uploadFile()">Upload File</button>
        </div>
    </div>

    <script>
    async function uploadFile() {
        const file = document.getElementById('fileUpload').files[0];
        if (!file) {
            alert('Please choose a file to upload first.');
            return;
        }

        try {
            // Request a pre-signed URL from your server
            const response = await fetch(`https://mvni37cg8e.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/csv`);
            const data = await response.json();
            const presignedUrl = data.location;

            if (uploadResponse.ok) {
                alert('File transformed successfully. Download from ', location);
            } else {
                alert('File transform failed.');
            }
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error uploading file:', error);
            alert('Error uploading file.');
        }
    }
