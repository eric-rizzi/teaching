A series of resources, including curriculum, but a single teacher (Phil Bagge).
Lots of stuff for lower school based around the idea of PRIMM and code
exploration. They do a good job giving a lot of resources and explaining how
they could be used, but it has a "grab bag" kind of feel to it and is a bit
difficult to navigate. Overall, I wish it were more opinionated about what the
current best thing is.
