# 3D Printing Data

I worked with the science department (physics) to allow them to 3D print data
that the students gathered during various experiments. It initially came about
as a way to show students what measurements of magnetism on a electrified plate
looks like, but it really can be anything.

# Robozzle

Robozzle is a wonderful little logic game originally created in 2009 by Igor
Ostrovsky. The [original game](http://www.robozzle.com/beta/) let's you program
a small robot to make your way through a bunch of levels designed by others. It
does a great job teaching how functions work and what the function call stack
is. Unfortunately, Robozzle was starting to show it's age. That's when I found
[this fully client-side version](https://alexanderson1993.github.io/robozzle-react/)
of the game. I have since helped update it a bit a put it in better shape for
teaching.

# PythoShop

The UCLS CS department has an amazing project that where students create their
own photo-editing software (similiar to PhotoShop). It does a great job teaching
students about loops, functions, colors, and files. Since arriving at UCLS, I
have helped Dan and Marty on the project in varous ways.

# Image Library

A series of interesting images I've captured... mostly to link to in worksheets.
These images include ones that I've created myself and that students have
created.
