# 3D Printing Data

I worked with the science department (physics) to allow them to 3D print data
that students gathered during various experiments. It initially came about as a
way to show students what measurements of magnetism on a electrified plate looks
like, but you could really print any data that has three dimensions (x, y, and
some third "height" value).

# Search Space Exploration Game

I created this small JavaScript game to illustrate how search space exploration
works. It's basically a computer game-ified version of my "Search Space Battleship"
lesson.

# Robozzle

Robozzle is a logic game originally in 2009 by Igor Ostrovsky. The
[original game](http://www.robozzle.com/beta/) lets you program a "robot"
through a bunch of levels using recursion and loops. It does a great job
helping students visualize how functions work. Unfortunately, Robozzle was
starting to show its age. That's when I found a fully client-side version
of the game. I have helped update it a bit a put it in better shape for teaching.

# PythoShop

The UCLS CS department has an amazing project that allows students to create their
own photo-editing software (similar to PhotoShop). It does a great job teaching
students about loops, functions, colors, and files. Since arriving at UCLS, I
have helped the other intro teachers on the project in various ways.

# Image Library

A series of interesting images I've captured... mostly to link to in worksheets.
These images include ones that I've created myself and that students have
created.
