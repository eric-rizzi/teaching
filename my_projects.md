# 3D Printing Data

I worked with the science department (physics) to allow them to 3D print data
that the students gathered during various experiments. It initially came about
as a way to show students what measurements of magnetism on a electrified plate
looks like, but it really can be anything.

# Image Library

A series of interesting images I've captured... mostly to link to in worksheets.
These images include ones that I've created myself and that students have
created.
