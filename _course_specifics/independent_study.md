### Course Highlights

This independent course allows advanced students to work their way all the way
up to the creation of a modern web-app that calls an AWS hosted back-end. Along
the way, students will learn about key Python concepts to make their code less
buggy as well as software engineering techniques/best-practices that allows
their ideas to scale. The course relies heavily on both independent GoogleDoc
worksheets and the use of ChatBots to guide the student from the basics all the
way up to the cutting edge.

#### Unit 0: Intermediate Python

This unit serves as the entry point for the course. It is designed to quickly
get students up to speed in terms of what objects are and how they work. The
goal is _just_ to get the proficient enough that they can understand code that
is being output by ChatBots. It is **not** intended to take the place of a real
class on Objects.

In the unit, students will create versions of Pong and Fishy. There is very
tight integration between the worksheets and the code that students are using.
This is because they are using the PRIMM method where students modify existing
code before attempting to create their own.

##### Keywords

Python, Grok, Pygame, Objects, Functions, PRIMM, Fishy, Pong

#### Unit 1: Command-Line

This unit provides students the basic tools on the command-line to be able to
make/use the terminal in the units on `git` and `docker`. As with the previous
unit, the goal here is to get students quickly up to speed in terms of using
the terminal. It is expected that they will then be able to use the ChatBot to
get the necessary commands to do future, more difficult tasks.

##### Keywords

Terminal, Shell, Linux, GameShell

#### Unit 2: Git

This unit teaches students the basic concepts of git. The learn how to set up
a local repository and create simple, single branch commits. In addition, they
learn how to set up a remote repository in order to save and test their work.
Again, this unit is **not** intended to give students a complete understanding
git. Instead, since they are working alone, a lot of the complexity can be
hidden and they merely need to understand enough to be able to interact with/
get help from the ChatBot.

##### Keywords

Commits, GitLab, Conventional Comments, CI/CD

#### Unit 3: Advanced Python

This is the final "background concepts" unit for students. It is intended to
help them brush up on their Python and to understand the importance of types.
I chose comprehensions and generics very specifically because most students
won't have ever seen them and they provide a good basis of discussion about the
importance of having good, easy to understand, difficult to break code.

##### Keywords

Generic Types, Comprehensions, Objects

#### Unit 4: ChatBot Aid

This is the first unit where students are specifically instructed to use a
ChatBot to help create something that they might otherwise struggle to complete.
The point of this unit, as with the other, future units, is to get students
comfortable with using a ChatBot to augment their abilities while simultaneously
forcing them to reflect/understand the code that is being created.

In particular, this unit has students create a series of GitHub Pages websites
of increasing complexity. The final, most difficult one is a "spinner" that I
can use in my other classes to pick an in-class participant. The goal is for
them to see the web as a series of html websites with various API back-ends.

#### Unit 5: AWS Dev Part 1

This unit has students start to create a (very simple) backend API for their
website. It guides them through the creation of a simple lambda (compute),
dynamodb table (memory), and s3 bucket (storage) that does some simple
functionality.

Getting up to speed on this can be fairly difficult, so the worksheets are
designed to prompt students to both use a ChatBot **and** consider the output
being produced by the ChatBot. The goal is for students to come to understand
that AWS is simply a wrapper for their code that allows it to be easily run/
scaled on the internet.
