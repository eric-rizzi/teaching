### Course Highlights

This independent course allows advanced students to work their way all the way
up to the creation of a modern web-app that calls an AWS hosted back-end. Along
the way, students will learn about key Python concepts to make their code less
buggy as well as software engineering techniques/best-practices that allows
their ideas to scale. The course relies heavily on both independent GoogleDoc
worksheets and the use of ChatBots to guide the student from the basics all the
way up to the cutting edge.
