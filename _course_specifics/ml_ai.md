### Course Highlights

This course introduces students to both the technological and philosophical
underpinnings of the current AI revolution. The course is 1/3 philosophy and
ethics, 1/3 programming, and 1/3 software engineering practices. As the course
progresses, students are encouraged to take more and more use of ChatBots to
help them produce code more quickly. The theory is that ChatBots provide a new,
higher abstraction level that students should learn to interact with.

The class itself is designed to mold around the current AP curriculum. The
reason for this is that many students in the class will take the AP class the
year after taking this class and many students in the class have already taken
the AP class. Therefore, the course focuses on a more functional, learn as you
go approach.

### Course Units

Units include:

#### Unit 00: Foundations of Intelligence

![Search Space Battleship]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ml_ai/search_space_battleship.jpg)

In this unit, we explore the technical and philosophical roots of AI. We first
talk about how most problems can be thought of as a form of search. Then we
talk about (and demonstrate) the original Turing Test and what its strengths/
weaknesses are. After this, students do a quick "skills assessment". On the last
day of the assessment, they are encouraged to use a ChatBot to aid them. This
leads to a final discussion about the role of ChatBots for learners.

#### Unit 01: SDE Boot Camp

In this unit, students are exposed to the core technologies that enforce good
engineering practices. They learn to use the terminal, git, and deploy projects
that utilize CI/CD. The point of this is not to turn them into experts, but to
expose them to the power of these tools that, should they choose, will allow
them to scale their knowledge in future classes. Throughout the rest of the
year, they will be returning to these tools again and again, reinforcing their
understanding.

#### Unit 02: Introduction to Data Science

In this unit, students really get to programming. In particular, they learn to
use Python to represent different types of data visually via the matplotlib
library. In the process, students use the Monte Carlo method to find the area
of a circle experimentally, see how difficult it is to create a truly random
series of numbers, and examine old texts to see how language has changed through
the decades. In the process, students learn how good data can lead to interesting
conclusions while bad data can lead them astray.

#### Unit 03: Lists, Sets, and Maps

In this unit, students learn about the power of Python's built-in data
structures. In particular, they learn about the properties that the core data
structures share and what makes them unique. From this foundation, students
start to visualize different ways to link and traverse data. They come to
understand how to build graphs and use them to represent FSMs and Markov Chains.
The end result is the creation of a simplistic ChatBot that highlights how data
and program combine to create an interesting result.

#### Unit 04: Learning Machines

In this unit, students are given the basic vocabulary, concepts, and experiences
required to understand how ML is used in the "real world". Then, students will
use this ML terminology to accurately discuss and critique _their own_ learning
experience. In particular, students will read and discuss various aspects of
teaching/learning such as the purpose of grades and how humans learn best. The
unit culminates with students creating their own lesson plan for a three class
unit on debugging with references to best practices for both machine and human
learning.

#### Unit 05: Bayesian Learning

In this unit, students will develop simple "Bayesian Deciders" (not to be
confused with Bayesian Classifiers, which are a bit too complex for the median
student). They will investigate this by playing the game Skull, creating a
simple, text-based Black Jack game, and analyzing cancer data. The overall
point of the unit is to have students appreciate how you can make better
predictions about the future if you rely on data that matches your current
situation as much as possible.

#### Unit 06: App Development 1

In this unit, students are given the opportunity to create a project from
scratch. This serves as an opportunity for them to build on all of the learning
theory that we have just done and to interact with the ChatBot in a much more
open-ended way. Students will be grouped into twos and threes and with the goal
of creating a pong game of escalating complexity. Every class, students will be
given custom goals to accomplish "next". This iteratively increasing complexity
requires them to wrestle and reshape their code, resulting in real-world
instances of debugging and problem solving.
