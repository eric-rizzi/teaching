### Course Highlights

The machine learning class is designed to mold around the AP curriculum. The
reason for this is that many students in the class will take the AP class the
year after taking this class and many students in the class have already taken
the AP class. Therefore, the course focuses on a more functional approach. In
doing so, the class relies on games, exploration, and philosophical discussion
to drive learning. Finally, as the course progresses, students are encouraged
to take more and more use of ChatBots to help them produce code more quickly.
The theory is that ChatBots provide a new, higher abstraction level that
students should learn to interact with.
