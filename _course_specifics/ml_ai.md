### Course Highlights

This course introduces students to both the technological and philosophical
underpinnings of the current AI revolution. The course is 1/3 philosophy and
ethics, 1/3 programming, and 1/3 software engineering practices. As the course
progresses, students are encouraged to take more and more use of ChatBots to
help them produce code more quickly. The theory is that ChatBots provide a new,
higher abstraction level that students should learn to interact with.

The class itself is designed to mold around the current AP curriculum. The
reason for this is that many students in the class will take the AP class the
year after taking this class and many students in the class have already taken
the AP class. Therefore, the course focuses on a more functional, learn as you
go approach.

### Course Units

Units include:

#### Unit 0: Foundations of Intelligence

![Search Space Battleship]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/search_space_battleship.jpg)

In this unit, we explore the technical and philosophical roots of AI. We first
talk about how most problems can be thought of as a form of search. Then we
talk about (and demonstrate) the original Turing Test and what it's strengths/
weaknesses are. After this, students do a quick "skills assessment". On the last
day of the assessment, they are encouraged to use a ChatBot to aid them. This
leads to a final discussion about the role of ChatBots for learners.
