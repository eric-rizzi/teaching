### Course Highlights

This course introduces students to the technological and philosophical
foundations of the AI revolution. The course is 1/3 philosophy and ethics,
1/3 programming, and 1/3 software engineering practices. As the course
progresses, students are encouraged to use ChatBots to help them produce code
and understand new ideas more quickly. At each step, students then reflect on
their experience to see if the ChatBot added to, or detracted from their
learning.

The class is designed to mold around the current AP curriculum. The reason for
this is that many students in the class will take the AP class the year after
taking this class and many students in the class have already taken the AP
class. By focusing on philosophy, ethics, and Software Engineering, students of
all abilities are exposed to new and challenging content.

### Course Units

Units include:

#### Unit 00: Foundations of Intelligence

![Search Space Battleship]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ml_ai/search_space_battleship.jpg)

In this unit, we explore the technical and philosophical roots of AI. We first
talk about how most problems can be thought of as a form of search. Then we
talk about (and demonstrate) the original Turing Test and what its strengths/
weaknesses are. After this, students do a quick "skills assessment". On the last
day of the assessment, students are encouraged to use a ChatBot to aid them.
This leads to a final discussion about the role of ChatBots for learners.

#### Unit 01: SDE Boot Camp

In this unit, students are exposed to the core technologies that enforce good
engineering practices. They learn to use the terminal, git, and deploy projects
that utilize CI/CD. The point of this is not to turn them into experts, but to
expose them to the power of these tools that, should they choose, will allow
them to scale their knowledge in future classes. Throughout the rest of the
year, they will be returning to these tools again and again, reinforcing their
understanding.

#### Unit 02: Introduction to Data Science

In this unit, students get to programming. In particular, they learn to use
Python to represent different types of data visually via the matplotlib library.
In the process, students use the Monte Carlo method to find the area of a circle
experimentally, see how difficult it is to create a truly random series of
numbers, and examine old texts to see how language changes over time. In the
process, students learn how good data can lead to interesting conclusions while
bad data can lead them astray.

#### Unit 03: Lists, Sets, and Maps

In this unit, students learn about the power of Python's built-in data
structures. In particular, they learn about the properties that the core data
structures share and what makes them unique. From this foundation, students
start to visualize different ways to link and traverse data. They come to
understand how to build graphs and use them to represent FSMs and Markov Chains.
The end result is the creation of a simplistic ChatBot that highlights how data
and program combine to create an interesting result.

#### Unit 04: Learning Machines

In this unit, students are given the basic vocabulary, concepts, and experiences
required to understand how ML is used in the "real world". Then, students will
use this ML terminology to accurately discuss and critique _their own_ learning
experience. In particular, students will read and discuss various aspects of
teaching/learning such as the purpose of grades and how humans learn best. The
unit culminates with students creating their own lesson plan for a three class
unit on debugging with references to best practices for both machine and human
learning.

#### Unit 05: Bayesian Learning

In this unit, students will develop simple "Bayesian Deciders" (not to be
confused with Bayesian Classifiers, which are a bit too complex for the median
student). They will investigate this by playing the game Skull, creating a
simple, text-based Black Jack game, and analyzing cancer data. The overall
point of the unit is to have students appreciate how you can make better
predictions about the future if you use data that matches your present.

#### Unit 06: AI in Society

In this unit, students talk about different ways that AI might fit into modern
society. Students discuss the importance of originality, what a super-
intelligence might look like, and what happens when there's misalignment
between what humans want and what an AI is pursuing. The overall goal will be
to decide the roles AI might play in the future and what tradeoffs come with
possible role.

#### Unit 07: App Development 1

In this unit, students are given the opportunity to create a project from
scratch. This serves as an opportunity for them to build on all of the learning
theory that we have just done and to interact with the ChatBot in a much more
open-ended way. Students will be grouped into twos and threes and with the goal
of creating a game of escalating complexity. Every class, students will be given
tailored goals to accomplish "next". This iteratively increasing complexity
requires them to wrestle and reshape their code, resulting in real-world
instances of debugging and problem solving.
