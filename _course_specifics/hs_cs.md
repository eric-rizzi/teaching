### Course Highlights

The High School computer science course is designed to provide all freshmen
a base level of understanding of important topics in computer science. Units
include:

#### Digital Representation

#### Introduction to Python

The Introduction to Python course is taught using the [Grok Learning](https://groklearning.com)
framework as it's foundation. On top of Grok, we supplement the material with
various PRIMM based activities. These include old classics like having students
create MadLibs (strings) and Personality Quizzes (variable) to our own ideas
such as teaching Prisoners Dilemma (lists) and EmojiPics (loops).

In the ends, students are able to effectively read, write, and modify code to
