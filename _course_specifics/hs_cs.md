### Course Highlights

The High School Computer Science course is designed to provide all freshmen
a base level of understanding of important topics in Computer Science. Units
include:

#### Digital Representation

The course begins with a unit exploring how different types of data are
represented on a computer. Students come to understand that computers simply
hold 1's and 0's and that the only thing that changes is the way these 1's and
0's are interpreted.

Activities include an ASCII-based scavenger hunt, the
[Flippy Bit Game](https://flippybitandtheattackofthehexadecimalsfrombase16.com/),
and introduction to hex editing software in order to change from one emoji to
another.

##### Keywords

Data, Binary, Hexadecimal, RGB, Encoding, Decoding, Number Systems, ASCII

#### Introduction to Python

The Introduction to Python unit is taught using the [Grok Learning](https://groklearning.com)
system as its foundation. On top of Grok, we supplement the material with
various PRIMM based activities. These include old classics like having students
create MadLibs (strings), Personality Quizzes (variables), and Turtles (loops)
to our own ideas such as teaching Prisoners Dilemma (lists) and EmojiPics
(loops).

In the end, students are able to effectively read, write, and modify code to
solve particular problems.

##### Keywords

Programming, PRIMM, Python, Lists, Variables, Loops, Turtles, EmojiPics

#### Intermediate Python

Given the basic understanding of Python that students got in the previous unit,
this set of classes is designed to give students a rigorous look into how
computers actually work and how they can be used to model real world phenomena.
In particular, there is a large emphasis on the power of functions illustrated
through fractals and recursion. In addition, students come to understand the
file system better by creating their own favicon via a hex editor and beginning
to use `vscode`.

##### Keywords

Programming, PRIMM, Python, File System, Fractals, Recursion

#### Image Manipulation via Python

![Green Screen Bear]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bear_green.jpg)

This final programming unit has students create bitmap transformations (e.g.,
converting an image to black and white, combining two images) to give students
additional practice with loops, conditionals, and functions. In addition, it
reinforces the concepts of data on the file system being a set of 1's and 0's
that can be manipulated. The unit is particularly nice because it scales to
the wide variety of skill sets seen in a gen-ed class with a large number of
"stretch problems" for even the most motivated/advanced students.

##### Keywords

Programming, Python, Pixels, RGB, Photo Editing, PhotoShop
