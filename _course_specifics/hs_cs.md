### Course Highlights

The High School Computer Science course is designed to provide all freshmen
a base level of understanding of important topics in Computer Science. Units
include:

#### Digital Representation

The course begins with a unit exploring how different types of data are
represented on a computer. Students come to understand that computers simply
hold 1's and 0's and that the only thing that changes is the way these 1's and
0's are interpreted.

Activities include an ASCII-based scavenger hunt, the
[Flippy Bit Game](https://flippybitandtheattackofthehexadecimalsfrombase16.com/),
and introduction to hex editing software in order to change from one emoji to
another.

##### Keywords

Data, Binary, Hexadecimal, RGB, Encoding, Decoding, Number Systems, ASCII

#### Introduction to Python

![Grok Academy]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/grok.jpg)

The Introduction to Python unit is taught using the [Grok Learning](https://groklearning.com)
system as its foundation. On top of Grok, we supplement the material with
various PRIMM-based activities. These include old classics like having students
create MadLibs (strings), Personality Quizzes (variables), and Turtles (loops).
It also includes a several new activities such as a Connections-esque game. The
focus of these supplementary activities is to give students an ability to show
their creativity in what could otherwise be a bit of a rote, boring sequence.

In the end, students are able to effectively read, write, and modify code to
solve particular problems.

##### Keywords

Programming, PRIMM, Grok, Python, Conditional, Variables, Loops, Turtles, EmojiPics

#### Programming in Practice

This second unit on Python teaches students about ways to generalize programs
and exploit patterns to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.
In particular, we start to move away from Grok (since I don't really like their
more advanced units) and tackle a bunch of different problems from a wide-array
of disciplines. This includes having students create a Prisoner's Dilemma "bot"
to fight in a class-wide tournament.

##### Keywords

Programming, PRIMM, Python, Lists, Functions, EmojiPics, Prisoners Dilemma, 

#### Fractals and Recursion

![Fractal Tree]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/forest.jpg)

Given the basic understanding of Python that students got in the previous units,
this set of classes is designed to expose students to recursion. The purpose of
the unit is to allow them to experiment with different ways to decompose
problems and wrestle with the fact that there are many ways to write a correct
program. In addition, this dive into recursion reinforces previously learned
concepts such as functions, and shows students how computers can be used to
model real-world phenomena.

##### Keywords

Programming, PRIMM, Python, Functions, Call Stacks, `vscode`, Fractals, Recursion

#### Image Manipulation via Python

![Green Screen Bear]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bear_green.jpg)

This final programming unit has students create bitmap transformations (e.g.,
converting an image to black and white, combining two images) to give students
additional practice with loops, conditionals, and functions. In addition, it
reinforces the concepts of data on the file system being a set of 1's and 0's
that can be manipulated. The unit is particularly nice because it scales to
the wide variety of skill sets seen in a gen-ed class with a large number of
"stretch problems" for even the most motivated/advanced students.

##### Keywords

Programming, Python, Pixels, RGB, Photo Editing, PhotoShop
