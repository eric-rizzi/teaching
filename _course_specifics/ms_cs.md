### Course Highlights

The Middle School course emphasizes creativity, drawing, movement (when
possible), and sharing of students work in the class. Units include:

#### Scratch Game Progression

Students begin the course by creating a series of five video games of increasing
complexity. Each game is easily understandable, fun to play, can be completed
by all levels of students in a class period, and is easily extendable. The
progression allows for a rhythm to quickly build where students learn a
new concept and then quickly apply it.

##### Keywords:

Conditionals, Gameloop, Loops, Games, Self-Directed, Pair Programming

#### Abstraction in All Forms

![Computers at varying levels of abstraction]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/abstract_computers.jpg)

This unit is a four-class progression on abstraction where students are asked to
analyze abstraction from a variety of different angles. This includes drawing
their own abstract art for a Pictionary-type game, understanding how a toilet
works, and solving a series of logic puzzles. In the end, students come away
with an appreciation for why abstraction is necessary for thinking and
communication as well as how it is used within Computer Science.

##### Keywords:

Magic, Technology, Abstraction, Programming, Functions

#### Computer Storage

This unit extends the [CS Unplugged](https://youtu.be/VpDDPWVn5-Q?si=l9Kg5dQSOvpgjQUm&t=1708)
lesson that teaches students how binary can be used to represent different
types of information. The unit begins with talking about Morse code and how
"beeps" and "boops" can send letters. Then, students learn how 1's and 0's
can be used to encode images. In the process, they create their own 8x8 image,
encode it in binary, and then send it "across the internet" to a friend to see
if they are able to decode it and get the same image.

##### Keywords:

Information, Binary, Encoding, Decoding, Representation

#### Harry Potter Themed Terminal Scavenger Hunt

![Harry Potter Learning Terminal]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hp_terminal.jpg)

This unit teaches students the bare essentials of terminal. In the process, they
are required to remember information they previously learned in the class and
have a great time running around the school trying to find the next clue for
the hunt.

The reason this lesson is powerful is not because students learn a bunch of
terminal commands. Instead, it is because it addresses the fact that most
students have an innate belief that the terminal is something "evil" that only
hackers or the geniuses would use. By having them quickly learn the basics of
something that seemed mysterious to them before, they gain confidence when
approaching new technology.

##### Keywords:

Magic, Terminal, Summative, Linux, Power

#### Computer Dissection

This unit introduces students to the hardware that underlies all modern
computers. In the first class, students act out how a computer loads different
types of data and operates on it. In the second, they take apart various types
of computers (desktops/chromebooks) and identify key properties about them
such as "how fast is a CPU". This mini "scavenger hunt" as they take apart a
computer leads to discussion about data, bits, and even Moore's law.

##### Keywords:

CPU, Hard Drive, Memory, Mother Board, Moore's Law, Interactive

#### Right to Repair

There is a famous quote by Arthur C. Clark that "sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic". In this final portion of the MS class, we
reflect on how technologies transition from "magic" to "understandable" as
you learn more about them. In doing so, we draw on experiences from the class in
terms of programming, learning about the terminal, and taking apart computers.
These experiences are then compared with the "Right to Repair" movement, which
is fundamentally about allowing people to take control on the technology that
they own. The leads to a discussion about how relying on the abstraction that
companies and technologies provided is a double-edged sword: providing both an
ease and a potential loss of power. Finally, the class ends with a call for
students to trust their own ability to figure things out and not be passive
consumers.
