Welcome! My name is Eric, and I am currently a Middle School/High School teacher
at the [University of Chicago Laboratory School](https://www.ucls.uchicago.edu/).
Prior to working at Lab, I worked at AWS, GrammaTech, UNL, and Wilmington Friends
School.

This website is intended to be a single point where all the resources that I
have found/used/created for teaching over the years can be catalogued. If you
have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!
